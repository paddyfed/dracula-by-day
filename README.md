## dracula-by-day

This is a retelling of the Dracula story but based on each day that the events occur. The book follows each person as they recount the days events in diary entires and letters. I will try to show the events in a chronological order for each day.

Dracula is available from Project Gutenburg https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/345 so this is what I will be using as my source.
